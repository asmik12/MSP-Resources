\subsection*{Overview}
Related rates problems involve finding the rate at which one quantity is changing using information about other known quantities. 

Most related rates problems you will encounter at the level of Math 31A/B will require roughly the following steps in their solutions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Relationship:} Establish a relationship between the variables. \\Relationships/Equations to consider: Trigonometric, Equations of area, surface area and volume of common geometrical shapes, mathematical similarity, equation of speed etc.
    \item \textbf{Derivative}: Take a derivative of that relationship (often with respect to time). This step involves implicit differentiation. Review this concept if you need to before attempting these problems. 
    \item \textbf{Substitution:} Substitute known values (sometimes this step will also involve using the relationship established before to find some value that you need)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Helpful Equations}

\textit{Geometry}

$$\text{Area of a circle} = \pi r^2$$

$$ \text{Volume of sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^2$$

$$\text{Surface area of sphere} = 4 \pi r^2$$

$$\text{Volume of cone or pyramid} = \frac{1}{3}\times \text{base area} \times \text{height}$$

$$\text{Area of curved surface of cone} = \pi r \times \text{slant height}$$

$$\text{Arc length of circle} = r\theta \text{ \hspace{3pt}($\theta$ in radians)}$$

$$\text{Area of sector of circle} = \frac{r^2\theta}{2} \text{ \hspace{3pt}($\theta$ in radians)}$$

\noindent\textit{Trigonometry}
$$\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$$
$$\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1$$
$$1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta$$
$$\cot^2\theta + 1 = \csc^2\theta$$
